        //1. Write a method in Java to get the difference between the largest and smallest values in an array of integers.
        //      The length of the array must be 1 and above. Use loops and conditionals to develop the algorithm.

        //2. Write a method in Java to find the smallest and second smallest elements of a given array and print it in the console.
        //      Use loops and conditionals to develop the algorithm.

        //3. Create an Employee class to represent an employee of a company. Add all relevant properties and behaviors
        //      that you might need but you have to include a salary property. Don't forget to add getters and setters.

        //4. Create an Intern class that extends from Employee. All the Interns have a salary limit of 20000 (constant).
        //      You must validate if an intern is created (or salary updated) with a bigger salary than the max. The max value is set.

        //5. Write a program that creates 10 Employees and print it al the properties.
